PlacesApp
=========

In order for your code to work, you will need a Google API key. You will need to open up the PlacesController, search for onSearchfieldKeyup, and replace 'enter key here' with your key.

Please note that because we dynamically create a URL for our store, clicking Load Data on the store in the Project Inspector will not work.
